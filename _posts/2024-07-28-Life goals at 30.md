2. Use the money which I earned to buy two leica cams (m1x, mp)
3. Be proficient in using a sewing machine to make small bags and edc backpack design under your own understanding (difficult) 
4. Japanese level is equivalent to IELTS 5.5 in Eng(I think it is enough), and I can communicate with native jp people.  (difficult) 
5. Reasonable understanding of the process, materials, steps, installation and design of house decoration

时间很长却也很快.

感觉人还是要活的现实一点, 不要太有梦想, 做一些本身有实际价值事情, 而不是感动自己/他人的事情.
