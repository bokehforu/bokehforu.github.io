Focued mode

Diffuse mode 

**Focued mode**

什么是focusing.使用比喻来解释，a pinball game works by, you pull back on the plunger, release it, and a ball goes boinking out, bouncing around on the rubber bumpers, and that's how you get points.

So, here's your brain, with the ears right here, and the eyes looking upwards. And we can lay that pinball machine right down inside it. So, there you go. There's the analogy for the focused mode.






So look at how that thought moves smoothly around on the fuzzy underlying orange neural pathway. In some sense it's as if it's traveling along a familiar, nicely paved road. But what if the problem you're working on needs new ideas or approaches?

**Diffuse mode**

To get to this new thought pattern, you need a different way of thinking. And that's represented here, by the diffuse mode. Look at how widely spaced the rubber bumpers are. Thought takes off, look at how it moves widely, bounces around. It could travel a long way before being interrupted by hitting a bumper. In this diffuse mode of thinking, you can look at things broadly from a very different, big-picture perspective. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways. You can't focus in as tightly as you often need to, to finalize any kind of problem solving. Or understand the finest aspects of a concept. But you can at least get to the initial place you need to be in to home in on a solution.



This course is meant to help you reframe how you think about learning, to help reduce your frustration.

### Video 2

To gain muscular structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing your muscles to grow. Similarly, to build neural structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on a little bit, every day, and that's the trick.



We learned about how the brain's two different thinking modes focused and diffuse, each helps us learn but in very different ways. Finally, we learned that learning something difficult can take time. Your brain needs to alternate it's ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material. Thanks for learning about learning. I'm Barbara Oakley.

1. 数学和科学的抽象性：文章指出数学和科学的抽象性是这些学科有时更具挑战性的原因之一。相比之下，我们可以通过实际事物来理解和感知其他抽象概念，而数学和科学的概念往往没有直接的对应物。
2. 实践对学习的重要性：文章强调了在学习数学和科学时实践的重要性。通过实践，可以加强神经连接，使抽象的概念更加具体和实际。文章还提到了大脑通过实践形成的神经模式的比喻。
3. 学习方法：文章介绍了一种学习方法，即集中学习一段时间后休息或转换注意力，以便大脑在后台进行深度思考和巩固概念的理解。文章还提到了使用番茄工作法（Pomodoro Technique）来克服拖延症，并建议进行有针对性的短期集中学习。
4. Chunking（分块）：文章提到下一步将讨论"chunking"，即如何掌握和理解关键概念的重要要素。然而，这一点在给出的文本中并没有具体展开。



### v6 记忆概论



1. Memory Systems: The two major memory systems are working memory and long-term memory.
2. Working Memory: It is the part of memory involved in immediate and conscious processing of information. It is centered in the prefrontal cortex and has limited capacity (about four chunks of information).
3. Blackboard Analogy: Working memory is compared to an inefficient mental blackboard that requires repetition to retain information.
4. Metabolic Vampires: Refers to natural dissipating processes that can cause memories to fade if not repeated or reinforced.
5. Long-Term Memory: It is like a storage warehouse distributed across different regions of the brain. Different types of long-term memories are stored in specific areas.
6. Revisiting Information: To effectively store information in long-term memory, it is necessary to revisit it multiple times to increase the chances of recall later.
7. Immense Capacity: Long-term memory has the capacity to store billions of items, but information can become buried and difficult to retrieve without proper practice.
8. Importance of Long-Term Memory: Long-term memory stores fundamental concepts and techniques relevant to learning and understanding new information.
9. Working Memory's Role: Working memory is used to process and handle new information but transferring it to long-term memory requires time and practice.
10. Spaced Repetition: A technique that involves repeating information over time with spaced intervals. It enhances the transfer of information from working memory to long-term memory.
11. Effectiveness of Spaced Repetition: Research shows that spaced repetition over multiple days is more effective for memory retention compared to mass repetition in a short period.
12. Analogy of Building a Wall: Just as a brick wall needs time for the mortar to dry and strengthen the structure, synaptic connections in the brain require time to form and strengthen for better memory retention.
13. Reference to the Acropolis: The Acropolis is mentioned as an example of a lasting structure, metaphorically indicating the importance of establishing strong and enduring memories.



### v7 睡眠

1. Awake state and brain toxins毒素: Being awake generates toxic products in the brain.
2. Brain cleansing during sleep: When you sleep, brain cells shrink, increasing the space between them. This allows fluid to flow and wash away toxins.
3. Importance of sleep: Sleep helps keep the brain clean and healthy, contrary to it seeming like a waste of time.
4. Effect of sleep deprivation: Insufficient sleep can result in a buildup of metabolic toxins, impairing clear thinking. It can also be associated with various negative conditions and health risks.
5. Sleep and memory consolidation: Sleep plays a crucial role in the memory and learning process. It helps organize and strengthen important memories while erasing less important ones.
6. Neural rehearsal during sleep: The brain rehearses challenging aspects of learning during sleep, reinforcing neural patterns.
7. Sleep enhances problem-solving: Sleep improves problem-solving abilities and understanding of learned material. Deactivation of the conscious mind in the prefrontal cortex facilitates communication between brain areas.
8. Dreaming and learning: Going over learned material before sleep increases the chances of dreaming about it. Dreaming about the material can enhance understanding and consolidate memories.
9. Focused mode and diffuse mode: Engaging in focused mode work before sleep helps activate the diffuse mode, aiding in learning and problem-solving.

###  What is a chunk? 

**Chunking** is the **mental leap** that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning. 
The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger
picture of what you're learning. 

这种概念的运作方式类似于将计算机文件压缩成ZIP文件，将许多信息整合成一个更容易处理和记忆的单元。

chunking是一种认知策略，有助于将信息整合成更大的概念块，使学习和记忆更加高效。



在学习新的信息或技能时，形成一个"chunk"（块）的过程可以被看作是将信息逐渐整合在一起的过程，以便更有效地理解和应用。



**数学和科学学习**：当你学习新的数学和科学材料时，通常会提供带有详细解答的示例问题。这是因为在你尝试理解如何解决问题时，你的认知负担很重。因此，从一个解决方案的示例开始有助于你理解问题的关键特征和基本原理。但要注意，不要只关注为什么执行一个步骤，而忽略了各个步骤之间的联系，即为什么下一个步骤是你应该执行的下一步。这就像使用地图来帮助你前往新地方旅行一样，要注意使用地图时周围发生的事情，很快你就能自己到达目的地，甚至能够找到新的到达目的地的方式。

*注：主要是联系*

### 如何制作一个"chunk"（块）

"chunking"的基本原理可以应用于各种领域，无论是学习智力思维还是身体运动。

**第一步**：集中精力关注你想要制作"chunk"的信息。这意味着在学习过程中要避免分散注意力，不要同时看电视、查看手机或电脑消息等，因为这会妨碍大脑专注于"chunking"新材料。当你开始学习新知识时，你正在建立新的神经模式，并将它们与大脑各个区域的"preexisting patterns"连接起来。如果你的思维被其他想法占据，会影响到你的学习过程。



I'm going to lean a little more towards explaining chunking of mental ideas rather than physical body motions, but you'll see that the two approaches are closely related. 

 **The first step** on chunking is simply to focus **your undivided attention** on the information you want to chunk.

 When you **first** begin to learn something, you're making **new neural patterns** and connecting them with **preexisting patterns** that are spread through many areas of the brain. Your octopus tentacles 章鱼触须, so to speak, can't reach very well if some of them are off on other thoughts using up some of the limited slots in your working memory. 

**The second step** in chunking is to understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk, whether its understanding a concepts such as continental drift, seeing the connection between the basic elements of a plot for a story, grasping the economic principle of supply and demand, or comprehending the essence of a particular type of math problem. Students can often synthesize the **gist**主旨, that is figure out the main idea or ideas pretty naturally, or at least they can grasp those ideas if they allow the focused and diffused modes of thinking to take turns in helping them figure out what's going on. Understanding is like a super glue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together. It creates broad *encompassing* traces that can link to other memory traces. Can you create a chunk if you don't understand? Yes, but it's often a useless chunk that won't fit in with or relate to other material you're learning. That said, it's important to realize that just understanding how a problem was solved for example, does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later. 



of a breakthrough and understanding with solid *expertise*. That's part of what you can grasp an idea when a teacher presented in class, but if you don't review it fairly soon after you first learned it, it can seem incomprehensible when it comes time to prepare for a test. In math and science related subjects, closing the book and testing yourself on whether you yourself can solve the problem you think you understand will speed up your learning at this stage. 

You often realize the first time you actually understand something is when you can actually do it yourself. It's the same in many disciplines. Just looking at someone else's painting doesn't mean you could actually create that painting yourself, and just hearing a song won't give you the expertise you need to sing it in the same resonant fashion. Just because you see it or even that you understand it, it doesn't mean that you can actually do it. **Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery**.

**第三步**：获得上下文，以便不仅知道如何使用这个"chunk"，还知道何时使用它。上下文意味着要超越初始问题，更广泛地看待问题，并进行重复和实践，不仅与相关问题一起，还与无关问题一起，以便不仅知道如何使用"chunk"，还知道何时不使用它。这有助于你看到你新创建的"chunk"如何适应更大的图景。上下文是底层和顶层学习相遇的地方。它意味着你不仅要学会使用某种问题解决技巧（底层学习），还要学会何时使用该技巧而不是其他技巧（顶层学习）。

**The third step** to chunking is **gaining context**, so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk. Context means going **beyond the initial problem** and **seeing more** broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems, so that you can see not only when to use the chunk but when not to use it. This helps you see how your newly formed chunk fits into the bigger picture. In other words, you may have a tool in your strategy or problem solving tool box but if you don't know when to use that tool it's not going to do you a lot of good. Ultimately, **practice** helps you broaden the networks of neurons that are connected to your chunk, ensuring it's not only firm but also accessible from many different paths. As you can see from this top-down, bottom-up illustration, learning takes place in two ways. There's **a bottom-up chunking process** where practice and **repetition** can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to. There's also a **top-down big picture process** that allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in. Both **processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material**. Context is where bottom-up and top-down learning meet. To clarify here, chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem solving technique. C**ontext means** learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique. **Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book before you begin studying it,** glancing at pictures and section headings can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture, so can listening to a very well-organized lecture. These kinds of activities can help you know where to put the chunks you're constructing, how the chunks relate to one another; just as you see here with the image of the man in the car. Learn the major concepts or points first, these are often the key parts of a good instructor or on book chapters, outline, flow charts, tables, or concept maps. Once you have this done, fill in the details. Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can still see the big picture. So, there you go. 

Summing it up, chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context. Those are the essential steps in making a chunk and fitting that chunk into a greater conceptual overview of what you're learning, but there's more. Thanks for learning how to learn.

## 能力错觉

The importance of recall, illusions of
competence in learning.

 very simple, technique. Recall. After you've read the material, simply
look away, and see what you can recall from the material
you've just read. 

Including simply rereading the text a
number of times. Or drawing concept maps that supposedly
enrich the relationships in the materials under
study.



When we retrieve knowledge, we're not just
being mindless robots. The retrieval process itself enhances deep
learning, and helps us to begin forming chunks. It's almost as if the recall process helps
build in little neural hooks, that we can hang our
thinking on.

开始分块

thought, concept mapping, drawing
diagrams that show the relationship between the concepts
would be the best. 

Using recall, 在头脑中检索关键观点，而不是*passive*地重读



因为看书比回想更容易，所以学生们在学习的过程中坚持他们的
这样的学习方式效果并不好。这就提醒我们，只要想
并不能保证你能真正学会。有一个超级有用的方法，可以确保你在学习，而不是用能力的幻想来欺骗自己，那就是测试自己在学习什么。



回忆，而不是边看书边复习，但这里还有一个小窍门，在你不在通常的学习地点时回忆材料
也能帮助你加强对材料的掌握。你没有意识到，但当你学习新知识时，你常常会你在学习新知识时，往往会在潜意识中接受到当时学习材料时周围房间和空间的提示。

This can throw you off when you take tests
because you often take tests in a room that's different from the
room you were learning in. By recalling and thinking about the
material when you are in various physical environment, you become independent of thecues from any one given location. That helps you avoid the problem of the test room being different from where you originally learned the material.

## week2 是什么激励了你？

Certainly, here is a summarized list of key points from the provided text:

1. **Interest Facilitates Learning**: Learning is easier when you are genuinely interested in the subject matter.

2. **Neurons and Information Processing**: The neurons in your cortex process information about your surroundings and actions.

3. **Neuromodulators and Importance**: Neuromodulators carry information about the importance and value of experiences rather than their content.

4. **Three Important Neuromodulators**: Acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin are discussed as important neuromodulators.

5. **Acetylcholine and Learning**: Acetylcholine is crucial for focused learning when paying close attention. It activates circuits related to long-term memory.

6. **Dopamine and Motivation**: Dopamine is a key chemical influencing motivation and reward learning. It plays a significant role in decision-making.

7. **Dopamine and Addiction**: Addictive drugs increase dopamine activity, leading to craving and dependence.

8. **Loss of Dopamine Neurons**: Loss of dopamine neurons can result in a lack of motivation, anhedonia, and even Parkinson's disease.

9. **Serotonin and Social Behavior**: Serotonin affects social behavior, with higher levels seen in dominant individuals and lower levels in risk-takers and inmates with violent behavior.

10. **Emotions and Learning**: Emotions are intertwined with perception, attention, learning, and memory. The amygdala is a key brain structure for integrating emotions and cognition.

11. **Website for More Information**: Brainfacts.org is recommended as a resource for further information on acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin.

12. **Conclusion**: The message concludes by emphasizing the importance of keeping the amygdala "happy" for effective learning.

## week 2 组块库的价值

文章主要讨论了“分块（chunking）”在学习和创新思维中的重要性。

1. **分块的概念**：分块是一种压缩信息的方法，使得我们能够更有效地存储和检索信息。

2. **创新与分块**：分块能够帮助人们以新颖和创造性的方式组合信息。例如，Bill Gates等行业领袖会专门安排长时间的阅读期，以便他们能一次性掌握多种多样的观点。

3. **跨学科应用**：分块不仅在特定领域有用，而且可以跨学科地应用。这种跨学科的应用被称为“转移（transfer）”。

4. **专家与分块**：例如，国际象棋大师能快速访问数千种不同的棋局模式；音乐家、语言学家和科学家也有自己的知识分块。

5. **分块的训练**：随着经验的增长，你所创建的分块会变得更大，更稳固。这些分块形成了你的“神经模式库”。

6. **专注模式与发散模式**：专注模式用于顺序、逐步的思考，而发散模式则更多地依赖于直觉和跨领域的联接。

7. **不断练习的重要性**：如果你不练习你所学的分块，它们可能会逐渐模糊，从而影响你对大局的理解。

8. **直觉的局限性**：虽然直觉非常有用，但它生成的解决方案需要通过专注模式来仔细验证。

9. **学习的积累效应**：一旦你掌握了第一个概念并将其加入你的“心智库”，那么第二个、第三个概念就会更容易地被加入。




这个文本主要是关于"chunking"（数据分块）以及"diffuse and focused modes of thinking"（散漫和集中的思考模式）在学习和问题解决中的作用。文本解释了如何通过分块技术将知识和概念组织成易于理解和应用的"块"，以提高问题解决和创新思考的能力。

1. **数据分块（Chunking）**: 数据分块是一种通过将复杂信息分解成易于理解和记忆的小块来增强记忆和学习的技术。这不仅有助于信息存储，还有助于在不同的情境和学科之间应用这些信息，这被称为“转移”（Transfer）。

    - **创新与分块**: 分块能帮助人们在思维中持有多个和不同的概念，这有助于在创新思考中形成新的和原始的组合。

    - **跨领域应用（Transfer）**: 一个分块的概念不仅在一个领域内有用，而且可以应用到其他完全不同的领域。

2. **散漫和集中思考模式**:
  
    - **集中模式（Focused Mode）**: 用于逐步、有逻辑地解决问题或学习新概念。
    
    - **散漫模式（Diffuse Mode）**: 用于在看似不相关的分块概念之间建立联系，从而解决新颖的问题。
    
    - **整体直觉（Holistic Intuition）**: 散漫模式通常用于形成直觉或洞见，这些直觉需要通过集中模式进行验证。
    
3. **实践与大局观**:
    - 如果不经常使用和练习你的“分块”，它们可能会逐渐淡出记忆，导致难以组织和应用这些信息。
    
    - 贯穿全文的是一个积极的态度：坚持和努力会让学习变得更加容易。

总体而言，分块和思考模式是高效学习和解决问题的两个关键组成部分。不仅如此，这两者相互作用，使个体能够更灵活、更具创造性地应对各种挑战。

``` 
The ability to combine chunks in new and original ways underlies a lot of historical innovation. 

week-long reading periods so that they can hold many and varied ideas in mind during one time. This helps generate their own innovative thinking by allowing fresh in mind, **not yet forgotten ideas to network amongst themselves.** Basically, what people do to enhance their knowledge and gain expertise, is to gradually build the number of chunks in their mind, valuable bits of information they can piece together in new and creative ways. 

The bigger and more well-practiced your chunked mental library, whatever the subject you're learning, the more easily you'll be able to solve problems and figure out solutions. As we'll discover soon, chunking isn't all you'll need to develop creative flexibility in your learning, but it's an important component. 

Chunks can also help you understand new concepts. This is because when you grasp one chunk, you'll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field but also in very different fields. This idea is called **transfer**. For example, concepts and problem solving method you learned for physics, can be very similar to chunked concepts in business. I found some aspects of language learning were very helpful for me when I later began to learn computer programming. A chunk is a way of compressing information much more compactly. As you gain more experience in chunking in any particular subject, you'll see that the chunks you're able to create are bigger, in some sense that the *ribbons* are longer. Not only are those ribbons longer, but the neural patterns are in some sense darker. They're more solid and firmly ingrained. If you have a library of concepts and solutions internalized as chunked patterns, you can think of it as a collection or a library of neural patterns.

Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems. 

Another way to think of it is this, as you build each chunk it is filling in a part of your larger knowledge picture, but if you don't practice with your growing chunks, they can remain faint and it's harder to put together the big picture of what you're trying to learn. 

In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter. You'll start to see patterns and simplify problem-solving for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking 潜伏 at the edge of your memory. Before midterms or finals, it can be easy to brush up and have these solutions at the mental ready. 

There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems. 

First, **through sequential step-by-step reasoning** and second, **through a more holistic intuition**整体直觉. 

**Sequential thinking** where each small step leads deliberately故意的 towards a solution, involves the **f**ocused mode. 

**Intuition** on the other hand, often seems to require this creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts. 

**Mos**t difficult problems and concepts are **grasped through intuition,** because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with. Keep in mind that the diffuse modes, semi-random way of making connections means that the solutions it provides should be very carefully verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't always correct. 


你可能认为题太多。没办法全学完， 这就是 law of Serendipity 将要应用的地方. Just focus on whatever section you're studying只要专注于你在学习的地方. You'll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily and the third more easily still你会发现你一旦把一个概念放进思维库，无论什么概念，那么第二个相关的概念就会非常容易，第三个也是. Not that all of this is a snap, but it does get easier. 不是非常快的，但是这确实是变得容易。
```

### Einstellung

When you're learning a new idea, for
example a new vocabulary word or a new concept or
a new problem solving approach, you sometimes tend to practice it over and
over again during the same study session. 

当你在学的时候，你会在一个session中重复学习的倾向。

A little of this is useful and
necessary, but continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you
can in the session is called overlearning. 但是这在大多数时候是没有用的。Overleaning can have its place.过剩也有它的道理。 It can produce an automaticity
that can be important when you're executing a serve in tennis or
a perfect piano concerto.不知道 If you choke on tests or public speaking,
overlearning can be especially valuable. 准备考试或者公共演讲有用。Did you know that even expert public
speakers practice on the order of 70 hours for
a typical 20-minute TED Talk? Automaticity can indeed be helpful
in times of nervousness, but be wary of repetitive overlearning
during a single session.要警惕重复练习。 Research has shown it can be
a waste of valuable learning time.研究证明浪费时间。 The reality is, once you've got
the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the
same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections
you want to have strengthened.一旦你有了basic的想法或者联系后，你应该远离它， Worse yet, focusing on one technique
is a little like learning carpentry by only practicing with a hammer. 更糟糕的是，只专注于一种技巧
就像只用锤子练习木工一样。After awhile you think you can fix
anything by just bashing at it.一段时间后，你会觉得
任何事情都可以靠敲打来解决。 Using a **subsequent study** session to repeat
what you're trying to learn is just fine and often valuable.少吃多餐学习 It can strengthen and
deepen your chunked neuron patterns.可以帮助你 chunk “神经元模式”。 

重复学习也是好的，下面。。It can also bring the illusion of
competence that you've mastered the full range of material, when you've
actually only mastered the easy stuff. 重复学习会带来以为自己掌握的错觉，但是实际上你只是掌握了简单的内容。Instead, you want to balance your
studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult. This focusing on the more difficult
material is called deliberate practice. 相反，你要平衡你的
通过有意识地把重点放在你认为更难的地方来平衡你的学习。这种专注于较难的地方称为刻意练习。这往往是
好学生和优秀学生之间的区别。

All this is also related to
a concept known as Einstellung."Einstellung "的概念 In this phenomenon,
your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural
pattern you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or
solution from being found. 最开始的在心中的想法或者一个neural
pattern已经被发展和强化，可能会诞生更加好的解决办法。 We saw this in the focus pinball picture, where your initial pinball of thought
went to the upper part of the brain, but the solution thought
pattern was in the lower part.弹球思维
是在大脑的上半部分，而解决问题的思维模式
模式却在下部。 The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and the previous patterns you
built can create a sort of rut that prevents you from springing to a new
place where the solution might be found. Incidentally, the German word
einstellung means mindset. Basically you can remember
einstellung as installing a roadblock because of the way you were
initially looking at something. This kind of wrong approach is
especially easy to do in sports and science, not to mention other disciplines,
because sometimes your initial intuition about what's happening or
what you need to be doing is misleading. 聚焦模式的拥挤碰撞和你以前建立的模式
会让你产生一种束缚感，使你无法跳到一个新的地方去寻找解
可能找到解决方案的地方。顺便提一下，德语中的
einstellung 的意思是心态。基本上，你可以把
einstellung 就是安装路障，因为你最初看待事物的方式是
安装路障。这种错误的方法
尤其是在体育和科学领域，更不用说其他学科了、
因为有时你对正在发生的事情或你需要做的事情的最初直觉
因为有时你对正在发生的事情或你需要做的事情的最初直觉会产生误导。You have to unlearn your
erroneous older ideas or approaches even while
you're learning new ones. One significant mistake
students sometimes make in learning is jumping into
the water before they learn to swim. In other words, they blindly start working
on homework without reading the text book, attending lectures,
viewing online lessons, or even speaking with someone knowledgeable. This is a recipe for sinking. It's like randomly allowing a thought to,
kind of pop off in the focus mode pinball machine, without paying any real attention
to where the solution truly lies. Understanding how to obtain real solutions
is important in learning and in life. Mastering a new subject means learning
not only the basic chunks, but also learning how to select and
use different chunks. 你必须在错误的旧观念或方法，甚至在学习新观念或方法的同时学习新的想法或方法。学生在学习过程中
学生在学习中有时会犯的一个重大错误就是
在学会游泳之前就跳进水里。换句话说，他们盲目地开始做作业
不读课本，不听讲座，不看在线课程，甚至不与有经验的人交谈，就盲目地开始做作业、
查看在线课程，甚至不与知识渊博的人交谈，就盲目地开始做作业。这是沉没的秘诀。这就好比随意让一个念头
弹球机中弹出来，而没有真正注意到解决方法的真正所在。
解决方案的真正所在。了解如何获得真正的解决方案
在学习和生活中都很重要。掌握一门新学科意味着
掌握一门新学科，不仅意味着要学习基本的知识块，还要学习如何选择和使用不同的知识块。
使用不同的语块。The best way to learn that is by
practicing jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require
different techniques or strategies. This is called interleaving. Once you have the basic idea of the
technique down during your study session, sort of like learning to ride
a bike with training wheels, start interleaving your practice
with problems of different types or different types of approaches,
concepts, procedures. Sometimes this can be
a little tough to do. A given section in a book, for example, is often devoted to
a specific technique, so when you flip to that section you already know which
technique you're going to be using. Still, do what you can
to mix up your learning. In science and math in particular it
can help to look ahead at the more varied problem sets that are sometimes
found at the end of chapters. Or you can deliberately try
to make yourself occasionally pick out why some problems call for
one technique as opposed to another.最好的学习方法是
练习在需要不同技巧或策略的问题或情况之间来回跳跃。
不同的技巧或策略。这就是所谓的交错练习。一旦你在学习过程中掌握了
在学习过程中掌握了技巧的基本概念后，就像学习骑自行车一样，开始交错练习不同类型的问题或不同类型的方法、
概念、程序。有时做起来有点困难。例如，一本书中的某个章节通常会专门讨论
因此，当你翻到那一节时，你已经知道你要用到哪种技术了。
技巧。不过，还是要尽力让你的学习更加丰富多彩。特别是在科学和数学方面
在章节末尾会有更多不同的问题集。
在章节末尾。或者，你可以有意识地偶尔让自己找出为什么有些问题需要一种技巧而不是另一种技巧。
为什么需要一种技巧而不是另一种技巧。 You want your brain to become used to
the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or
problem-solving technique isn't enough.你要让大脑习惯于
只知道如何使用特定的概念、方法或 解决问题的技巧是不够的。 You also need to know when to use it. 你还需要知道何时使用它。**Interleaving your studies,**
making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through
problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your
learning a little more difficult, but in reality,
it helps you learn more deeply.穿插学习、
例如，为了复习备考而跳过不同章节和材料中的问题，有时似乎会让你的学习变得枯燥乏味。
不同章节和材料中的问题，有时似乎会让你的学习 但实际上，它有助于你更深入地学习。 **Interleaving is extraordinarily important.交错是非常重要的。** Although practice and repetition is important in helping
build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts
building flexibility and creativity.**但交错学习才是建立灵活性和创造性的开始。** It's where you leave the world
of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently. 这让你离开练习和重复的世界，开始更加独立地思考。When you interleave within one subject or
one discipline, you begin to develop your creative

Philosopher of science
Thomas Kuhn discovered that most paradigm shifts in science are brought
about either young people or people who were originally trained
in a different discipline. They're not so easily trapped by einstellung, blocked
thoughts due to their preceding training. And of course there's the old saying that
science progresses one funeral at a time as people entrenched in the old
ways of looking at things die off. Finally, don't make the mistake
of thinking that learning only occurs in the kinds of subjects
you acquire from teachers or books. When you teach a child how to
deal effectively with a bully, or you fix a leaky faucet, or you quickly
pack a small suitcase for a business trip to Hong Kong, all of these illustrate the
outcomes of important aspects of learning. Physicist Richard Feynman was inspired
in his Nobel Prize-winning work by watching someone throw a dinner
plate into the air in a cafeteria. Mike Rowe of the television
shows Dirty Jobs and Somebody's Gotta Do It
shows how important and exciting learning can be in a variety
of different, non-academic disciplines.另一方面，如果你只在一门学科上发展

##WEEK3 拖延症与记忆概论

### 拖延症

我将教你懒人解决拖延症的方法。这意味着你将了解自己内心的 "僵尸"，即你的大脑在特定暗示下产生的常规习惯性反应。这些 **"僵尸反应 "**通常都是为了让此时此地变得更好。

与此类似，拖延症患者拖延的只是一件小事。他们一而再、再而三地这样做，逐渐养成了习惯。他们甚至可以看起来很健康，但长期效果并不好。

1. 你已经学习了一个非常实用的工具来帮助你解决拖延问题，即“番茄工作法”，也就是25分钟的不间断专注时间，后面跟着一点放松时间。
2. 学习避免拖延之所以重要，是因为好的学习是一个逐步的活动。
3. 意志力很难获得。它消耗了大量的神经资源。
4. 拖延可以是一个单一的、具有巨大影响的坏习惯，换句话说，它影响了你生活中许多重要的方面。

### 无处不在的僵尸思维

第一次开倒车很难

但是无数次后，你的大脑会进入一种僵尸模式，只对几个关键因素半知半解，而不是被所有数据淹没。骑自行车也是同样的道理。一开始很难，后来就很容易了。

Neuroscientifically speaking, chunking is related to **habit.** 

所以习惯是什么，an energy saver 

它能让我们解放思想，从事其他类型的活动。
你进入这种习惯性僵尸模式的次数远比你想象的要多，这就是习惯的意义所在。
在养成习惯的过程中，你不必集中精力思考自己在做什么，这样可以节省精力。

你可以把习惯看作由四个部分组成，第一部分是**线索。(cue)**

这是让你进入 "僵尸模式 "的触发器，线索可能很简单，比如看到待办事项列表中的第一项。比如看到要回家的信息。提示本身既无益也无害。重要的是常规，是我们对提示做出的反应。

Number two, the **routine.** 这是你的 "僵尸模式"，是你的大脑在收到提示时习惯性做出的常规反应。
僵尸反应可能有用、无害，有时也有害。

Number three, the **reward**.每个习惯的养成和延续都是因为它能给我们回报。
它能给我们带来直接的快感。拖延是一个很容易养成的习惯，因为它的奖励，即把你的注意力转移到更令人愉快的事情上，发生得如此迅速和容易。

第四，**信念。**
**belief。**习惯之所以有力量，是因为你相信它们。
例如，你可能觉得自己永远无法改变把学习拖到很晚的习惯。要改变习惯，你需要改变你的基本信念。

### 冲浪练习 结果与过程

学新大学有负面衬衣 凡吸毒面呈细 奴卡失效 就是和陈i像你风格有新的方法 

急症在结果 但是一个集中在错火车上呢个上 虚像做作业 反对就5 分到日版有此案骨气·那个作业和温暖男 不要在就看i问过上而实在估测婚个上个

专注的的番茄工作法，在工作片段上而不是在工作的结果

这样就将是过程关注在过程上而不是在一个痛苦的结果。

安静的学习

### 利用僵尸思维

应对反应

什么开始了zombo思维

**the cue** 

localtion 

time

how you feel

Reaction 

什么是拖延，比如看了眼手机然后不回了

**The routine**

Plan就行，

**The reward**

无论什么奖励。甚至设置一个目标5:00不搞别的事情就休息

### 应对生活与学习

weekly plan

每天新起一页写 然后在睡前写好 潜意识会帮助你构造这个目标

番茄工作 切换一个导向过程也是换一个process

时间工作量 的准确判断 

5pm之前完成，休息时间非常重要

努力在生活之余保持健康和空闲

### summing up procrastination

日志 比对

目标比对完成度

奖励留在最后

观测拖延症触发的开关

使用一个新度学习系统，比如使用🍅

注意休息，有时候休息，比如在5:00pp之后

## 记忆 虽然我感觉没什么用

### 深入记忆探索

祖先不记得文字，但是知道打猎的路，进化过程的需要，使用坐标位置，使用视觉记忆而不是单一背诵，甚至是感觉。

重复和复习

使用图像辅助记忆概念。重复，test，mixed 再记

### 如果不能学习 HM（人名）什么是长期记忆

分时段学习更加好。      fade？消失

### 创造记忆宫殿

记忆技巧

### 记忆总结

**connection** 

长记忆

store house  几天 长时间 提早开始 

**working memory**

  4 items    

**记忆技巧**

生动的画，感受生动有趣，简化材料

数字和有意义的数字

可视化记忆 分类方法 

熟悉场景可视化记忆 

有意义的缩写和 chunk 背诵理解的材料

## week4

### 怎么更好的learner

保持运动 促进神经元存活                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

### 复兴式学习

学习不是线性增长的概念 知识体系会坍塌 新知识吸收会花时间 

### 生动视觉比喻

f=ma的另外一种解释

### 不需要羡慕天才

<font color='red'>有点重要，看文字</font> 

有大的记忆力空间，因为思维是在原有的记忆力空间上促发诞生的，我们的思维思考方法是在原有的磨具上被发展的，换句话说就是，记忆力本身是智力的容量。

 ### 改变思维

觉得自己牛逼？

## week 4 下

### 团队的价值（脑）

研究主义 左脑感觉，在做完作业以后过度自信。

首先原则不要自我欺骗

什么是自己的盲区

脑力不够 与同学一起学习 察觉忽略 给同学讲解

学习小组而不是社交小组

### 测试清单 final

回答问题 我要如何准备考试

认真努力学内容吗，理解吗？

自己的观点

明白所有答案

study guide

相互提问

### 先难后易

在开始时候难，转向简单。focus mode 转向 diifuse mode

想一个并行操作的大厨

大脑不同部位都有功能

自制力 两分钟就转向 引发牵引力

### 压力 有益的最后提示

注意转向呼吸 深呼吸

保持好心情而不是焦虑

选择题，盖住选项 回想知识

stuble braided 

### summing up module 4

转变思维转变命运

检查问题，利用大脑功能，要休息，审视

太自信，与朋友一起学习

check 

先难后易 利用两个模式解题

紧张 深呼吸 

足够睡眠
